# CPU Scheduler Simulator

The CPU scheduler is the part of the operating system that decides which process to execute next. It is a key component that has a significant impact on the overall system performance. Programming a real CPU scheduler is a complex task. In this project, you have implemented a simplified simulator. The simulator will read a file containing a list of processes and simulate their execution according to different scheduling algorithms. The goal of this project is to understand the basic concepts of CPU scheduling and to learn how the different resources interact with each other in an operating system. Among these, we can mention:
* The scheduler, which is the part of the operating system that decides which process to execute next.
* The CPU, which is the part of the computer that executes the instructions of a program.
* The disk, as process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait.

## Score

* The project obtained a score of **19/20**
